#     Hi! I'm Dawna. I started baking gluten-free many years ago, as close friends and family members of mine were diagnosed with celiac disease and severe gluten allergies.
#     I love a baking or cooking challenge and whatever I make has to taste good. Goody Two Spoons is all about celiac-safe, delicious, gluten-free treats!
